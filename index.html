        About Me
    </h1>

    <section class="about-me">
        <p>
            My journey is a fusion of creativity, strategy, and technology. With a background in business and program management, I’ve built a career that bridges community impact, professional development, and tech-driven problem-solving. As the co-founder of Gratis Grove, I’ve led initiatives that address food insecurity and education access. My transition into tech began with The Knowledge House Web Development Innovation Fellowship, where I mastered full-stack development.  As tech is ever evolving, I am also actively expanding my skills other languages like Python. Currently pursuing my MBA with a concentration in Computer Information Systems, I leverage my diverse experiences to develop innovative solutions at the intersection of business and technology.
Beyond academics and professional work, I’ve been actively involved in leadership roles, from organizing events for graduate students to supporting Latinx professionals through Prospanica NY. My adaptability, quick learning ability, and problem-solving mindset drive me to create digital experiences that are both functional and impactful.
On a fun side, I am very interested in strength training, waking up at 4:30am to do so 5x a week, martial arts, recently started Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and more recently earned my scuba diving certification.
