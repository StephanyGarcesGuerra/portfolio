Stephany Garces Guerra – Portfolio Website

Description
This is my personal portfolio website, built using HTML and CSS, to showcase my journey, skills, and web development projects. It serves as a digital resume and a hub for connecting with potential collaborators, employers, and like-minded professionals. The site includes sections about me, my experiences, and the projects I’ve worked on, providing visitors with an engaging and user-friendly experience.

Design Concept
Simple to read one page website that uses my favorite colors, purple and pink, to highlight my self. Also included links to my resume and github account.
The color scheme is consistent between those colors, plain white for clickable buttons, and black to highlight the different portions of the page.

Technologies Used
HTML5 – Structure and content of the site.
CSS3 – Styling and layout.
